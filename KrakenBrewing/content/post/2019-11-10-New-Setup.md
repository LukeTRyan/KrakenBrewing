Last week, I purchased the Brewzilla 3.1 35L all-in-one brewing system along with a few bits and pieces. I also bought a huge fermentation fridge that should let me control temperature a lot better. My next brewday (Mango IPA) will be the first using this new system after only using BIAB in the past.
