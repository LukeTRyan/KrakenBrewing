Grain Bill  
-Base is pilsner, Vienna and Wheat malt to add body, head and character with a slight maltiness from the Vienna. Acidulated malt to lower mash pH.
Hops  
-Bittering hops to give approximately 30 IBUs and add spicy and fruity notes.  
-Kent Goldings, Saaz, or Willamette to add mild floral/herbal notes without overpowering the fruit.  

Water Chemistry  
Calcium: 50  
Magnesium: 5  
Sodium: 20  
Chloride: 30  
Sulfate: 100  
-Higher sulfates will give aid in drying out the beer and accentuating the hops/fruit.  

Notes  
Target mash temperature: 65-66c (lower mash temperature ideal to create a drier, more fermentable beer).  
Target pH: 5.2-5.3  
Fermentation Temperature: 25c  
Fruit: 3.5kg of frozen rasberries pureed and added to the end of the boil via a mesh bag.
