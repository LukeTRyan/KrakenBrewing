F﻿or this brew I'm trying out cryo hops for the first time in this [Bracket Brewing "Insert Name" hazy pale ale](https://untappd.com/b/bracket-brewing-insert-name/5250659). This recipe was adapted from a homebrewer who queried bracket brewing on their hazy pale ale recipe.

T﻿he grain bill for this beer is mostly pale malt, with a huge 30% of rolled oats and about 5% honey malt to give colour and a slightly sweeter/malty finish.

T﻿he hops for this beer are Motueka, Idaho7 and [Cryo Pop](https://cryopopblend.com/), previously known as trial blend TRI2304CR. Recent research suggests that high levels of monoterpene alcohols and polyfunctional thiols in a wort stream can create the conditions necessary for the yeast metabolism of hop-derived compounds, otherwise known as “biotransformation.” This hop blend has been developed to make use of briotransformation and to work as both a single hop or in conjunction with other tropical hop varietals. 

T﻿he yeast I've chosen is Verdant IPA, as it's easily available and I'm able to ferment it at higher temperatures to make use of fruity esters. I've had great results with Verdant in the past with hazy beers, so I'm confident it will do well here.

A﻿s with all my hoppy and hazy beers these days, I'll be fermenting under pressure towards the end of fermentation, and closed transferring to a keg that will be purged with the fermentation cO2.

Hey,

Chuffed that you're enjoying the Hazy Pales, it's a style we're putting a lot of focus on over the next few months.

In terms of base malt just grab whatever's locally available, think this was BB Pale, then load it up with as much oats as your system can comfortably handle, but don't go too silly (malted, rolled, golden naked whatever floats your boat), as low as 15% will get the job done, but more is better for mouthfeel. 

Mash reasonably high, you want it to finish with a decent amount of residual sugar but not cloying sweetness ~3°P

Bitter to your preferred bitterness, we usually put 20-25ish IBUs (theoretical, we haven't had it tested).

Moderate whirlpool addition of something with staying power. \[Insert Name] was Cryo Pop, not a hop we use very often but performed well here.

Ferment with your favourite hazy strain. This was Mogwai's Sherlock strain. Only strain I would stick away from is the Lallemand New England (I personally think it sucks).

REDDIT COMMENT ON PRESSURE FERMENTING:

"In my experience you may as well leave the spunding valve at zero until your first dry hop charge. You will possibly get more esters, and you won't end up with a hop volcano by dry hopping beer that is already starting to carbonate.

I do my neipas in a fermzilla, leave the pressure release totally open for the first 48-72 hours and then do one large dry hop, close it up, set spunding valve to 25ish and forget about it for 3-5 days then cold crash for 24 hours and pressure transfer to serving keg."

On a home brew scale I used to do a single dry hop and shake the fermenter a couple of times, commercially we do double but on a home brew scale it's difficult to get the hops out before the second dry hop. You'll get better extraction on at homebrew scale so I reckon 8g/L will get you there. Split it whichever you fancy, I think this was straight down the middle Mot:Idaho.

Let us know how you go. We'll be at Beer and BBQ in a couple of months so swing past and say hi if you're going to be there.

Cheers,
Mike
