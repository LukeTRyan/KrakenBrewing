# T﻿ips to avoid oxidation in homebrew

Brewing beer at home can be extremely rewarding. There's no greater satisfaction than reaching a level of proficiency when you can comfortably say "I would pay to drink this in a pub". However, with certain styles of beer and on a homebrew scale and budget, reaching that level (consistently) can be difficult. 

Oxidation is without a doubt one of the biggest banes of my existence (and a lot of other homebrewers out there). It can completely ruin a beer, and you'll usually only know after brewing, fermenting and spending a huge amount of time and effort. When you reach that final stage and see that you're beer is darkened in colour, lacks flavour and aroma, and tastes like wet cardboard, the only option is usually to dump it down the drain.

With this post, my aim is that I can share some tips on what oxidation looks like in a beer, how it happens and how to avoid it.

## W﻿hat is oxidation?

Oxidation in brewing refers to the chemical reaction that occurs when certain organic compounds in beer interact with oxygen. While oxygen is crucial during the early stages of brewing for yeast health and fermentation, exposure to oxygen post-fermentation can lead to undesirable changes in the beer's flavor, aroma, and stability. Oxidation can reduce shelf-life and deem a beer worthy of tipping down the drain. 

During the brewing process, after fermentation is complete, beer is typically transferred to storage vessels or packaging containers. If oxygen is introduced during these later stages, it can react with compounds in the beer, leading to oxidation. This process can result in various negative effects:

* Stale Flavors: Oxidation can cause beer to develop stale or cardboard-like flavors. Compounds such as aldehydes and ketones form as a result of oxygen interacting with certain molecules in the beer, leading to off-flavors.
* Loss of Aroma: Aromatics, particularly those derived from hops, can be sensitive to oxidation. Exposure to oxygen can cause the loss of delicate hop aromas, resulting in a less vibrant beer.
* Color Changes: Oxidation might also cause changes in beer color. Some beers, particularly lighter ones, may develop a darker hue due to oxidation reactions with certain compounds.

## H﻿ow can you avoid oxidation?

T﻿here's many ways oxidation can be avoided, some of them being more involved and expensive than others. I'll start by listing the most effective (and probably most expensive) ways of reducing oxidation exposure.

F﻿irstly, the best way is to reduce oxygen exposure in the fermenter. This can be achieved by using a fermenter that can withstand pressure. By fermenting under pressure, you remove the chance of oxygen to be introduced into the fermenter by constantly maintaining a positive pressure. This is also extremely important
