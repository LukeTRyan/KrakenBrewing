This sour is pretty much a copy of the strawberry sour/berliner weisse I did last time. The only changes i'm making this time around are:

\- Adding more fruit (4kg) in a pureed form (wholesale) which contains 15% sugar. This will up the ABV so the grain bill will be lower than normal. 

\- Fruit addition will be added during primary/secondary to get a fresher flavour and remove cooked-flavours. 

\- A mesh bag will be used to catch the Raspberry particles and make kegging easier. 

\- Removing acidulated malt and upping the lactic acid addition to reach 4.2-4.5ph pre souring. 

\- Water profile will be Brisbane water with 2g calcium sulfate, 4g calcium chloride and 11ml of lactic acid to reach 4.4pH.

**NOTES:**
-Mashed for 60 mins.\
-Sparged with approx 8L.\
-Boiled for 15 minutes to sterilize.\
-Pre-acidified wort with lactic acid to 4.4pH to aid souring, prevent spoilage and supposedly help head retention.\
