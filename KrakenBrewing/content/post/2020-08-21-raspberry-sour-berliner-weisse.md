This sour is pretty much a copy of the strawberry sour/berliner weisse I did last time. The only changes i'm making this time around are:

\- Adding more fruit (4kg) in a pureed form (wholesale) which contains 15% sugar. This will up the ABV so the grain bill will be lower than normal. 

\- Fruit addition will be added during primary to get a fresher flavour and remove cooked-flavours. 

\- A mesh bag will be used to catch the Raspberry particles and make kegging easier.

**NOTES:**
-Mash for 60 mins.  
-Sparge.  
-Boil for 15 minutes to sterilize.  
-Pre-acidify wart with lactic acid to 4.5pH to aid souring, prevent spoilage and supposedly help head retention.  
-Cool down to 32-33c.  
-Add Lacto culture. (IBS support pills (7) 140  billion lactobacillus plantarum)  
-Cover and let sit for ~12-36 hours at 31c until soured to your liking (3.2-3.4 pH).  
-Re-boil for 45 minutes with hop additions and finings.  
-Chill, pitch 2 packets yeast (With nutrient maybe), ferment.  

\-Pre-boil gravity was   ---  
-I'm aiming for a pH of 3.2-3.4.
