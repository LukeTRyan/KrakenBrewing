Time for another sour! This time it's going to be Mango, utilising 3kg of mango puree. The process will be the same kettle sour as my previous ones:\
\
- Flaked Oats will be added to give the beer body, mouthfeel and slight sweetness. 

\- Fruit addition will be added during primary/secondary to get a fresher flavour and avoid cooked-flavours.

\- A mesh bag will be used to catch the fruit particles and make kegging easier.

\- pre-acidifying the wort with lactic acid to reach 4.2-4.5pH.

\- Water profile will be Brisbane water with 2g calcium sulfate, 4g calcium chloride and 11ml of lactic acid to reach 4.4pH.
