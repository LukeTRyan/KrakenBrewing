For future reference, I'm going to briefly run through the process for a closed transfer, both pressurised and un-pressurised. The goal of this method is to reduce oxidation/oxygen contact on fermented beer. Oxidation can hugely impact the flavour and appearance of a beer, giving it off-flavours or causing hop flavour and aroma to dissipate. Therefore, it is important to reduce oxygen contact when transferring finished beer, especially heavily hopped beer. These methods will be suited for the SS Brewtech Brew Bucket or other stainless fermenters that are pressure rated to at least 1-2psi. 

## Method for pressurised closed transfer:

1. Place the empty keg on a scale to determine its weight pre and post fill.

2. Fill keg completely with sanitiser and sanitise all lines and connections (if using an in-line filter, push sanitiser through the filter and ensure all fittings are secured). 

3. Using CO2, purge keg of all liquid and keep under a low pressure (<3psi). 

4. Attach CO2 line to blowoff tubing of fermenter.

5. Connect beer line to the liquid out post (beer will flow in through the dip tube). 

6. Connect a spunding valve to the gas in post in order to regulate the keg CO2 level and keep a steady flow.

7. Remaining CO2 pressure in the keg will push O2 from the beer line. Once the keg has de-pressurised, attach the line to the fermenter spout. 

8. Apply slight pressure from the CO2 tank (1-2psi) and release the beer tap so beer flows into the fermenter.

9. Once finished, detach CO2, close fermenter tap and disconnect the beer line. Purge headspace with CO2. 



## Method for gravity closed transfer:

1. Repeat steps 1-3 above. 

2. Ensure the fermenter is higher than the keg. 

3. Attach the gas post to the blowoff tubing of the keg (the CO2 pushed from the keg when filling will flow back into the fermenter and provide some pressure). 

4. Connect beer line to the liquid out post (beer will flow in through the dip tube). 

5. Remaining pressure in the keg will push O2 from the beer line. Once the keg has de-pressurised, attach the line to the fermenter spout. 

6. Turn the tap and allow the beer to flow into the keg, using the low CO2 pressure and gravity to provide flow.

7. Detach beer and gas lines. Purge headspace with CO2.
