Distilled water will be used in order to customise the water chemistry (30L plus 2L of tap water for the remaining sparge). Adding 6.5g of calcium sulfate (gypsum), 3g of calcium chloride, 4g of magnesium sulfate (epsom salt) and 1 gram of baking sodat to the strike water will give a mash + sparge water profile of:  
Calcium 74 ppm  
Magnesium 13 ppm  
Sodium 11 ppm  
Chloride 50 ppm  
Sulfate 165 ppm  
The higher calcium and sulfate ions (low chloride/sulfate ratio) will enhance bitterness and bring out more hop flavour. Adding 100g of Acidulated Malt will bring down the mash pH to the desired level of 5.45 (room temp mash pH).

Brew Notes:  
-Temperature differences were similar for the hydrometer and refractometer, although the gravity was somehow lower after the boil. This may have been due to incorrect temperature differentials during the readings.  
-OG was around 1.060.  
-Dry hop additions were added on 13/1/2020 and will be left until bottling on 17/1/2020  
-Bought some straps to keep the temperature probe attached to the fermenter.  
-FG 1.010  
-23 bottle yield. Bottled on 17/01/2020. Put into fermentation fridge at 19c. Broke 1 bottle..  

-Tasted a bottle after 2 weeks. Perfect carbonation with great head retention. Citrus aroma with a slight maltiness and big bitterness hit up front. Very clean, easy drinking. No unfavourable notes (first time using RO water – may be due to lack of chloride/chloramine). Medium body, not too thin.
