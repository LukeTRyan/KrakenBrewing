Water Notes:  

**NOTES:**  
-Mash for 60 mins.  
-Sparge.  
-Boil for 15 minutes to sterilize.  
-Pre-acidify wart with lactic acid to 4.5pH to aid souring, prevent spoilage and supposedly help head retention.  
-Cool down to 32-33c.  
-Add Lacto culture. (IBS support pills (7) 140 billion lactobacillus plantarum)  
-Cover and let sit for ~12-90 hours at 31c until soured to your liking (3.2-3.4 pH).  
-Re-boil for 45 minutes with hop additions and finings.  
-Chill, pitch 2 packets yeast (With nutrient maybe), ferment.  

-Pre-boil gravity was 1.055  
-7 IBS pills were pitched (mistakingly without opening the caps) when the wort reached 35c.  
-I’m aiming for a pH of 3.2-3.4.  

-17 hours in, the pH was 4.5 (I pitched another 5 IBS pills, this time opening the capsules).  
-29 hours in, the pH was 3.6.  
-41 hours in, the pH was 3.5.  
-52 hours in, the pH was 3.4.  

-In fermenter on 23/01/2020. OG was a bit low at 1.040, possibly due to yeast contamination during souring and also the added water content of the strawberries. Pitched 2 packets of us05 at 18c.  
-31/1/2020 – FG at 1.011  
-Kegged the beer (first ever keg) on 7/2/2020 and set at 12psi at serving temperature. Tasted dry, fruity and sour, as hoped. Also made 2 bottles which are being left for bottle conditioning.  
-Instead of continuing to use store bought RO water (which is expensive), I’m going to buy some campden tablets to remove the plastic flavour given off by chlorine/chloramine in the water supply. I’m going back to using the brisbane water supply but will continue to alter the water chemistry based on the beer being brewed.
