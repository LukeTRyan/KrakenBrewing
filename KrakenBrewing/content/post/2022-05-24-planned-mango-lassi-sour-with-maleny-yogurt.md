The inspiration for this beer comes from the traditional Indian Lassi drink, a sweet or spiced yogurt-based drink, commonly flavoured with fruit such as Mango. I also took inspiration from a local brewery in Maleny, Queensland, named Brouhaha. The area is known for its production of wagyu and dairy cows, which Brouhaha uses in a symbiotic relationship. The brewery supplies spent grain as feed for the cattle, and uses the yogurt produced by the dairy cows to naturally sour it's Strawberry and Rhubarb Sour. In this recipe, I wanted to use the same process and the same locally-sourced yogurt to sour my beer and to give it the velvety, creamy consistency of Lassi. The foundation of the beer will consist of souring it with the Maleny yogurt, adding some lactose to counteract the sourness and to add to the body of the beer, and adding a large addition of Mango during the primary fermentation.
