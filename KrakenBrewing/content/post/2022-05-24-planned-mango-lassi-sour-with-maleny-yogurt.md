The inspiration for this beer comes from the traditional Indian Lassi drink, a sweet or spiced yogurt-based drink, commonly flavoured with fruit such as Mango. Like my other sours, this beer will have wheat and oat additions to add body and fullness. I'll also be adding some lactose to counteract the sourness add to the body of the beer. For the fruit addition, I'll be adding about 2kg of pureed mango as well as 1L of mango pulp (or mango nectar if I cant find the pulp).

Other notes:

* Few cardamon pods crushed and added to flameout (can be very overpowering, so start with 3)
* Philly sour yeast (fruit should be added within 48 hours to increase glucose levels and encourage lactic acid production). Temp should also be kept around 22-23.
* Might add some fruity hops to flameout for some added depth of flavour (Galaxy)
* 2kg of frozen mango puree and 1L of mango pulp or nectar
