For my next clone, I'm going to attempt to replicate Ballistic Brewing's "Hawaiian Haze" DDH Pale Ale. The tasting notes for this beer have been descriped as juicy, pineapple, hoppy and citric. It's light in colour with a solid haze. The hops used were Citra, Rakau, Pacifica and Mosaic. The malts are pale malt, rolled/flaked oats and rolled/flaked wheat. It has medium bitterness with 30 IBUs and an ABV of 4.6%. Using this information, I plan to make a recipe that replicates the beer as closely as possible.\
\
**Grain Bill**\
-Use of high protein grains such as flaked oats and wheat. \
\
**Hops**\
-Citra, Rakau, Pacifica and Mosaic, targetting 30 IBU in the boil with late additions and a substantial dry hop. The whirlpool should make up majority of the hop boil additions, aiming for 80-85c additions. \
\
**Chemistry**\
-a 2:1 Chloride to Sulfate ratio will accentuate the smooth malt body and not the hops, as they speak for themselves.

**Yeast**\
-London ale III will be used this time around.
