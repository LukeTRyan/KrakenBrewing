This recipe was taken from Hoppy day's recipe list as a standard german pilsener/lager. Grain bill was mostly german pilsener with some gladiator malt for head retention and body, as well as some acidulated malt to lower the mash pH and get as many fermentable sugars as possible. This was aided with a low mash temp. Yeast is Saflager 34/70 being fermented around 10-12c for 2 weeks with a 6-8 week lager in the keg.

*TARGET WATER PROFILE:*\
Profile Name: Brisbane water  

**NOTES:**\
-Target mash pH is 5.4, achieved with acid malt or lactic acid addition. Addition of 2g of gypsum and campden tablet.\
-rehydrate yeast with 20c sterile water and regulate to 12c with wort additions, then aerate and pitch.\
-4 days at 10c, 8 days at 12c and 2 days at 18-20c for diacytl rest. From here, transfer to keg and lager at 2-3c for 6-8 weeks, under pressure or not.\
\
-Diacytl rest started 17/08/20-18/08/20 with kegging on 19/08/20\
-kegging went well with a pressurised closed transfer. Some beer was lost due to untight fittings but only a minor amount. Need to remember to buy more hose clamps (12mm or so).
