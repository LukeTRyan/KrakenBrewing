I﻿n an effort to refine the Stone & Wood clone from [this ](https://krakenbrewing.netlify.app/post/2021-02-25-stone-wood-clone-2/)post, I've updated the recipe based on the results and inspiration from other sources (see link in notes). For the new batch, I'm adding some flaked wheat to add some more haze, and i'm lowering the percentage of ale malt. I'm also switching to american ale malt, in order to get a lighter colour. Finally, I'm increasing the dry hop to 100g and maintaining IBUs at around 22. I'm also experimenting with ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and sodium metabisulfite (SMB) during the dry hop, in an effort to reduce oxidation.

The updated recipe can be found here.

-﻿Brewed this batch today - everything went pretty well in terms of the conversion efficiency, OG and wort volume. I tried mashing out for the first time, as this was something I'd never done before and had seen that it's good practice to do. I did notice though that after sparging, the beer appeared very dark (given the light malts used). After some research, this is likely due to coagulating proteins in the mash, as this particular grain bill is fairly heavy in wheat. A﻿lso, mashing for longer tends to produce darker beers, as the wort has more contact time with the grains. Some people also mentioned that mash pH and calcium presence can affect the colour, but as I calculated the water and used all the correct additions, I don't think this is the cause.  After boiling, the colour returned and the brew looked normal, but after transferring into the fermenter (pre-yeast pitch) it looked very dark again. I added a whirfloc tablet during the boil, so this may also contribute to the protein coagulation and the darkened beer/extra clarity i'm noticing. Research says to just let it ride and see how it looks at the end, but if it's still darker in appearance, I may need to do further research or tweak my process for lighter, hazier beers. Overall though, the brew went really well and was pretty efficient. I do need to trim the hose length on my immersion chiller though, as the long ass hoses are getting annoying.\

-Yesterday was interesting. When attempting to find a leak in my fermenter, I stupidly took the safety collar off and applied too much pressure. It exploded, hit me in the face and now my eye socket is swollen. I definitely learnt my lesson, more about that [here](https://krakenbrewing.netlify.app/post/2023-01-12-valuable-life-lesson-learned-on-using-pressurised-fermenters/)

T﻿oday, I added the dry hop charge of 100g Galaxy. I noticed, as the yeast activity is starting to die down, the beer is darkening again. I'm mostly thinking it's just clarified a bit, and the colour will remain pale when in the glass in a smaller volume. For reference, here is what it's looking like post-ferment:
