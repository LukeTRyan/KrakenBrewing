      <description>&lt;p&gt;For this brew I&amp;rsquo;m making the &lt;a href=&#34;https://hoppydaysbrewingsupplies.com.au/product/bugalugs-dark-ale/&#34;&gt;Bugalugs Dark Ale from Hoppy Days Brewing Supplies&lt;/a&gt;. This is a British Brown Ale with a strong backbone of toffee and chocolate with a solid bitterness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The grain bill for this beer is built on a base of Voyager Veloria Schooner malt, with Munich malt adding depth and complexity. The colour and roasted character comes from Shepherds Delight, Dark Voodoo, and Carafa Special III malts, giving that classic toffee and chocolate profile without being overly roasty.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For this brew I&amp;rsquo;m trying out cryo hops for the first time in this &lt;a href=&#34;https://untappd.com/b/bracket-brewing-insert-name/5250659&#34;&gt;Bracket Brewing &amp;ldquo;Insert Name&amp;rdquo; hazy pale ale&lt;/a&gt;. This recipe was adapted from a homebrewer who queried bracket brewing on their hazy pale ale recipe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The grain bill for this beer is mostly pale malt, with a huge 30% of rolled oats and about 5% honey malt to give colour and a slightly sweeter/malty finish.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The hops for this beer are Motueka, Idaho#7 and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cryopopblend.com/&#34;&gt;Cryo Pop&lt;/a&gt;, previously known as trial blend TRI2304CR. Recent research suggests that high levels of monoterpene alcohols and polyfunctional thiols in a wort stream can create the conditions necessary for the yeast metabolism of hop-derived compounds, otherwise known as “biotransformation.” This hop blend has been developed to make use of briotransformation and to work as both a single hop or in conjunction with other tropical hop varietals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tips to avoid oxidation in homebrewed beer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Brewing beer at home can be extremely rewarding. There&amp;rsquo;s no greater satisfaction than reaching a level of proficiency when you can comfortably say &amp;ldquo;I would pay to drink this in a pub&amp;rdquo;. However, with certain styles of beer and on a homebrew scale and budget, reaching that level (consistently) can be difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Oxidation is without a doubt one of the biggest banes of my existence (and a lot of other homebrewers out there). It can completely ruin a beer, and you&amp;rsquo;ll usually only know after brewing, fermenting and spending a huge amount of time and effort. When you reach that final stage and see that you&amp;rsquo;re beer is darkened in colour, lacks flavour and aroma, and tastes like wet cardboard, the only option is usually to dump it down the drain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I think this is my 3rd time making this beer, and I&amp;rsquo;m making it again because I think it&amp;rsquo;s great hazy ale. In the past, I&amp;rsquo;ve had issues around oxidation for these hoppy and oaty beers, but now I&amp;rsquo;m at a comfortable place with controlling oxidation through use of preservatives and techniques like closed transfers. When I ordered this beer, I could only get a hold of golden oat malt, which I decided to use. Due to that, the beer ended up a bit darker than I had hoped, but the taste was actually pretty damn good.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Summer time means fruity sour. My homebrew shop is currently out of Wildbrew Philly sour, a strain of yeast that produces lactic acid as well as alcohol. This yeast has been my go-to for sours for the last couple of years, as it&amp;rsquo;s a lot less effort than kettle sours and produces similar results. However, I&amp;rsquo;m strapped for time given I want this beer done by Christmas, and Philly Sour isn&amp;rsquo;t really an option, so I&amp;rsquo;m going back to my kettle-sour roots.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;W﻿ith this beer, I wanted to return to the first sour I ever made, &lt;a href=&#34;https://krakenbrewing.netlify.app/post/2020-01-09-strawberry-sour/&#34;&gt;a strawberry sour&lt;/a&gt;. It was not long after covid had started, and I was spending a lot of time indoors as my workplace at the time (a bar) was frequently shut due to lockdowns. I remember spending hours and hours researching souring techniques and methods, and eventually made my first kettle sour. It was a beer I was extremely proud of, because all the effort of planning and research paid off.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I﻿t&amp;rsquo;s been a few years since I&amp;rsquo;ve done a stout, and winters coming up, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d give it another crack. The last stout I made was a &lt;a href=&#34;https://krakenbrewing.netlify.app/post/2019-12-12-dwarven-stout/&#34;&gt;coffee chocolate stout&lt;/a&gt;, which used cold-brew coffee and cacao nibs soaked in congac. It was pretty good, but I wanted to do something different this time. I&amp;rsquo;ll be keeping a similar grain bill and hops (Fuggles), but I&amp;rsquo;ll be adding lactose to round out the bitterness, and I&amp;rsquo;ll also be adding cacao nibs and 2 vanilla beans. These should add the vanilla and chocolate notes i&amp;rsquo;m after.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A﻿fter my last pacific/wheat ale, and success using sodium metabisulfite and ascorbic acid, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to take another crack at a Hazy IPA. This beer will feature Nectaron, which I&amp;rsquo;m trying for the first time, as well as BRU-1 and El Dorado, which I&amp;rsquo;ve had good results with in the past. As with my other Hazies, I&amp;rsquo;m aiming for a 2:1 chloride to sulfate ratio, heavy whirlpool and dry hop additions, and I&amp;rsquo;m looking to reduce oxidation as much as possible. I&amp;rsquo;ll be closed transferring under pressure and using SMB and ascorbic acid at my terminal dry hop.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Valuable Life Lesson Learned on Using Pressurised Fermenters</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I﻿ learned a valuable life lesson yesterday - If you&amp;rsquo;re dealing with pressurised vessels or containers, make sure there is something in place to stop it rapidly depressurising.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Y﻿esterday, I noticed that my pressure ferment of my Stone and Wood clone (link &lt;a href=&#34;https://krakenbrewing.netlify.app/post/2022-12-27-stone-wood-clone-3/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) was not building in pressure, even though my spunding valve was set to a higher psi. I listened closely to the fermenter lid and heard a small hissing sound. Upon investigating, I narrowed down the leak to either the lid itself or the carbonation cap. I replaced the carbonation cap with another after venting the pressure, however, after re-applying some C02, the leak was still there. Here is where my mistake took place. I took off the safety cap that keeps the lid in place on the fermenter and attempted to see if there were any cracks or places the C02 could escape. As the pressure was low, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t hear any hissing. I added about 10psi of C02 to the fermenter and loosely held my hand on the lid to keep it in place. While bent over, looking directly at the lid, the lid blew off the fermenter and hit me in the eye before sending itself half way across the garage. Key lesson here - never mess with pressurised containers without the proper safety measures in place. If the lid hit about an inch lower, I could have lost my right eye. Instead, I&amp;rsquo;ve got a swollen eye socket, 2 cuts above and below my eye, and an embarrassing story.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;L﻿uckily, I fixed the leak. Never again though am I going to apply pressure and stare directly into the main exit port of a fermenter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I﻿n an effort to refine the Stone &amp;amp; Wood clone from &lt;a href=&#34;https://krakenbrewing.netlify.app/post/2021-02-25-stone-wood-clone-2/&#34;&gt;this &lt;/a&gt;post, I&amp;rsquo;ve updated the recipe based on the results and inspiration from other sources (see link in notes). For the new batch, I&amp;rsquo;m adding some flaked wheat to add some more haze, and i&amp;rsquo;m lowering the percentage of ale malt. I&amp;rsquo;m also switching to american ale malt, in order to get a lighter colour. Finally, I&amp;rsquo;m increasing the dry hop to 100g and maintaining IBUs at around 22. I&amp;rsquo;m also experimenting with ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and sodium metabisulfite (SMB) during the dry hop, in an effort to reduce oxidation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;2﻿022 was a good year for brewing - I definitely got back into the swing of things and was able to brew a lot more beer than in 2021. While there was some dud beers (mostly due to oxidation..), the beers in general definitely improved in quality. I recognised that I branched out in styles as well, experimenting with different spices and yeasts. Of these, the Beglian White Ale (Witbier), Aussie Sparkling Ale and Mango Lassi sour were 3 notable beers that involved new ways of brewing with spices and different hop varietals. While I tend to stick to the same styles, I&amp;rsquo;m keen to branch out and try new things, mainly to keep things fresh and exciting. I&amp;rsquo;m also keen to try new methods, improve the efficiencies of my current process, and work on the limitations I&amp;rsquo;m currently facing.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I﻿n 2023, I have a few notable brewing improvements and styles I&amp;rsquo;m excited to try. In no given order, these are:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Going ahead with another fruited sour using the Philly Sour yeast. This time I think I&amp;rsquo;ll do a mix of darker fruits (Blackberry, Cherry &amp;amp; Raspberry) and see how that goes. Like my last sour, I&amp;rsquo;ve added some lactose to counteract the sourness. I also added some dextrose to the boil to give the yeast some glucose for lactic acid production. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably add the fruit around day 5-6, purge with some c02 and leave for 3-4 days until fermentation finishes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;D﻿ecided to have another crack at a hoppy hazy with this recipe from some dude on Facebook. For this brew, I&amp;rsquo;m trying out suspending the hops in a bag using magnets.. as a final effort to avoid oxidation. Closed transfers don&amp;rsquo;t seem to be working well enough, and I figured it may be due to opening the fermenter for dry hop additions, so we&amp;rsquo;ll see how this goes. I kinda screwed it up though because the hop bag is too big for the fermenter headspace.. so now the hops are slightly touching the wort. I&amp;rsquo;ll try limit the fermentation time of this batch to not drag out the hop exposure. I also forgot to use a Whirfloc tablet, but it might help contribute some slight haze. Ultimate goal of this batch is to just avoid oxidation. I&amp;rsquo;m also trying liquid yeast for the first time (Bluestone Yeast Co. New England ale strain). Hopefully it goes well, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t cheap.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The inspiration for this beer came from a night several years ago when I was working as a bartender. Myself and a few others headed to an American-style bar across the road on our break, for some food and beers. I ended up getting a Blue Moon on tap, not knowing what it is and expecting it to be a thin, watered down American lager. I was surprised to receive the opposite, a full-bodied, rich, citrusy and spicy Belgian-style ale with a slice of orange in it. It was fantastic, and that is the style and moment  I&amp;rsquo;m trying to recreate with this beer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The inspiration for this beer comes from the traditional Indian Lassi drink, a sweet or spiced yogurt-based drink, commonly flavoured with fruit such as Mango. Like my other sours, this beer will have wheat and oat additions to add body and fullness. I&amp;rsquo;ll also be adding some lactose to counteract the sourness add to the body of the beer. For the fruit addition, I&amp;rsquo;ll be adding about 4kg of pureed mango as well as 1L of mango pulp (or mango nectar if I cant find the pulp).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I decided to make a basic Australian Ale after having some bad luck with hazy, hoppy beers oxidising. Hoppy Days Brewing Supplies had this recipe for a Sparkling Ale, reminiscent of Coopers Sparkling Ale. This beer makes use of Australian malts (Voyager Pale Compass) and Australian hops (Pride of Ringwood) for a boil addition. Yeast used was SafAle k-97, a traditional german ale yeast.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;sparkling-ale&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sparkling Ale&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOPPY DAYS BREWING SUPPLIES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a recipe I took from Hoppy Days Brewing Supplies (Brisbane), which is a session NEIPA. This beer features low bitterness, heavily fruity/critrus hops and a full body with plenty of high-protein malts. This brew makes use of Verdant IPA yeast, which will aid in creating this hazy, hoppy fruit bomb. Although i&amp;rsquo;ve brewed this beer before, the first time was a dump due to heavy oxidation. This time around, I&amp;rsquo;m utilising the Fermzilla 27L to do a pressurised, closed transfer ferment, to avoid any oxidation. Hops will be loaded into the collection container and purged with CO2, to remove any possibility of oxygen getting in.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This Passionfruit and Vanilla sour was the next sour ale I had lined up in my list of fruited sours. This time around I&amp;rsquo;m using Lallemand&amp;rsquo;s Philly Sour yeast - A lactic acid producing yeast. This will be my first sour without using traditional kettle souring techniques with Lactobacillus Plantarum, so I&amp;rsquo;m interested to see how it turns out. Some people have said that this strain produces less lactic acid and thus less sourness than kettle souring, but this generally comes down to yeast health and fermentation conditions. I&amp;rsquo;m fermenting at 23c, as a higher temperature supposedly encourages greater lactic acid production. As for the additions, I&amp;rsquo;m adding 2kg of frozen Passionfruit Pulp from Hoppy Days Brewing Supplies in Brisbane. I&amp;rsquo;m also adding about 10ml of Vanilla Extract and 250g of Lactose to the boil (to counteract the sourness of the passionfruit and lactic acid). I&amp;rsquo;m aiming for a pH of around 3.3 and a FG of about 1.015, to give an ABV of approximately 5.4%.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For my next clone, I&amp;rsquo;m going to attempt to replicate Ballistic Brewing&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Hawaiian Haze&amp;rdquo; DDH Pale Ale. The tasting notes for this beer have been descriped as juicy, pineapple, hoppy and citric. It&amp;rsquo;s light in colour with a solid haze. The hops used were Citra, Rakau, Pacifica and Mosaic. The malts are pale malt, rolled/flaked oats and rolled/flaked wheat. It has medium bitterness with 30 IBUs and an ABV of 4.6%. Using this information, I plan to make a recipe that replicates the beer as closely as possible.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;Grain Bill&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;-Use of high protein grains such as flaked oats and wheat. &lt;br&gt;&#xA;-Marris Otter base, with some wheat malt, flaked oats and flaked wheat &lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;Hops&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;-Citra, Rakau, Pacifica and Mosaic, targetting 30 IBU in the boil with late additions and a substantial dry hop. The whirlpool should make up majority of the hop boil additions, aiming for 80-85c additions. &lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;Chemistry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;-a 2:1 Chloride to Sulfate ratio will accentuate the smooth malt body and not the hops, as they speak for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Time for another sour! This time it&amp;rsquo;s going to be Mango, utilising 3kg of mango puree. The process will be the same kettle sour as my previous ones:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;- Flaked Oats will be added to give the beer body, mouthfeel and slight sweetness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;- Fruit addition will be added during primary/secondary to get a fresher flavour and avoid cooked-flavours.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;- A mesh bag will be used to catch the fruit particles and make kegging easier.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The second beer I ever made was my first time going all grain. This recipe (&lt;a href=&#34;https://krakenbrewing.netlify.app/post/2019-05-16-snw-clone-biab/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) was a Stone &amp;amp; Wood clone, designed to loosely resemble the beer. While this was one of the most successful beers I&amp;rsquo;ve made, I decided to re-do it, this time with a much better, fine-tuned setup. The aim of this is to get an understanding on the impact of changing certain aspects to a brew and how they affect the end result. The grain bill is remaining mostly the same, with slightly more Wheat malt and Carapils. I&amp;rsquo;ve also increased the hop additions, adding slightly more bitterness and hopstand additions. Furthermore, I&amp;rsquo;ve tweaked the water chemistry in order to favour a light, hoppy ale, while removing chloramine with campden tablets. The beer will be kegged, whereas previously it was bottled, presenting more chance for oxidation. &lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The updated recipe can be found here:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This recipe is adapted from the HoppyDays Hazy Crusher IPA, a hazy session IPA with low bitterness, low ABV and a large dry hop addition. The yeast being used for this beer is the new Verdant IPA yeast. &lt;br&gt;&#xA;Target mash pH: 5.4 (need 5ml lactic acid)&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Target water profile: Approximately 2-1 chloride to sulfate&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hazy Session IPA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Brew Method: All Grain&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Style Name: American IPA&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Boil Time: 60 min&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Batch Size: 23 liters (fermentor volume)&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Boil Size: 27 liters&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Boil Gravity: 1.048&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Efficiency: 70% (brew house)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This sour is pretty much a copy of the strawberry sour/berliner weisse I did last time. The only changes i&amp;rsquo;m making this time around are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;- Adding more fruit (4kg) in a pureed form (wholesale) which contains 15% sugar. This will up the ABV so the grain bill will be lower than normal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;- Fruit addition will be added during primary/secondary to get a fresher flavour and remove cooked-flavours.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;- A mesh bag will be used to catch the Raspberry particles and make kegging easier.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Closed Transfer Guide</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For future reference, I&amp;rsquo;m going to briefly run through the process for a closed transfer, both pressurised and un-pressurised. The goal of this method is to reduce oxidation/oxygen contact on fermented beer. Oxidation can hugely impact the flavour and appearance of a beer, giving it off-flavours or causing hop flavour and aroma to dissipate. Therefore, it is important to reduce oxygen contact when transferring finished beer, especially heavily hopped beer. These methods will be suited for the SS Brewtech Brew Bucket or other stainless fermenters that are pressure rated to at least 1-2psi.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/post/2020-07-20-balter-xpa-clone/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This beer was designed to clone Balter&amp;rsquo;s XPA and be close as possible to the original. The head brewers released the hops they used, but not the grains or yeast. The clone grist consisted primarily of American Pale malt with some wheat and carapils for body/head retention and some cara malt for malty flavour. The water profile was higher in calcium and suflate to accentuate the hops, of which were primarily citrus/fruity. Mash was mid 60&amp;rsquo;s to increase fermentable sugar content and produce a semi-dry beer using US-05.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This recipe was taken from Hoppy day&amp;rsquo;s recipe list as a standard german pilsener/lager. Grain bill was mostly german pilsener with some gladiator malt for head retention and body, as well as some acidulated malt to lower the mash pH and get as many fermentable sugars as possible. This was aided with a low mash temp. Yeast is Saflager 34/70 being fermented around 10-12c for 2 weeks with a 6-8 week lager in the keg.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was my first fruit kettle sour/berliner weisse. I decided to go with pureed strawberries at the end of the boil and sour using IBS capsules. The wort was pre acidified with lactic acid and acidulated malt to aid the souring. Some citra hops were used to add a bit more depth and flavour and citrus backing to the beer. Next time I&amp;rsquo;d probably add the fruit in primary at the end of fermentation to get a fresher flavour, as boiling the strawberry made it taste slightly different and somewhat artificial.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Grain Bill&lt;br&gt;&#xA;-Base is pilsner, Vienna and Wheat malt to add body, head and character with a slight maltiness from the Vienna. Acidulated malt to lower mash pH.&#xA;Hops&lt;br&gt;&#xA;-Bittering hops to give approximately 30 IBUs and add spicy and fruity notes.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;-Kent Goldings, Saaz, or Willamette to add mild floral/herbal notes without overpowering the fruit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water Chemistry&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Calcium: 50&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Magnesium: 5&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Sodium: 20&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Chloride: 30&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Sulfate: 100&lt;br&gt;&#xA;-Higher sulfates will give aid in drying out the beer and accentuating the hops/fruit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Distilled water will be used in order to customise the water chemistry (30L plus 2L of tap water for the remaining sparge). Adding 6.5g of calcium sulfate (gypsum), 3g of calcium chloride, 4g of magnesium sulfate (epsom salt) and 1 gram of baking sodat to the strike water will give a mash + sparge water profile of:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Calcium 74 ppm&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Magnesium 13 ppm&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Sodium 11 ppm&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Chloride 50 ppm&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Sulfate 165 ppm&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The higher calcium and sulfate ions (low chloride/sulfate ratio) will enhance bitterness and bring out more hop flavour. Adding 100g of Acidulated Malt will bring down the mash pH to the desired level of 5.45 (room temp mash pH).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Designing the Recipe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;This time around, i’m going to be partly designing my own recipe for a coffee stout. This stout is basically going to follow these guidelines:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;-ABV between 5% and 7%.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;-Grain bill of 80% base malt + remaining specialty grains.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;-Between 30 and 40 IBUs from bittering additions of hops, with some at the end of the boil.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;-An Ale yeast with an attenuation of approximately 75% (Us-04/05 or wyeast 1056 American Ale)&lt;br&gt;&#xA;-A mash between 67c and 69c&lt;br&gt;&#xA;-Water chemistry adjusted to add hardness (increased calcium and carbonate)&lt;br&gt;&#xA;-2.5 volumes of C02&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This time around, I decided to go with a Mango IPA since I love mango and wanted to try making a fruit beer. I now have my Brewzilla 3.1 35L setup and a better, larger fermentation fridge. Hopefully this will up the quality of my homebrew and make the process a lot easier. The Mango is added during fermentation with the hops and left for a week or two.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mango IPA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.brewersfriend.com/homebrew/recipe/view/369037/hey-mango-ipa&#34;&gt;R﻿ecipe link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, I purchased the Brewzilla 3.1 35L all-in-one brewing system along with a few bits and pieces. I also bought a huge fermentation fridge that should let me control temperature a lot better. My next brewday (Mango IPA) will be the first using this new system after only using BIAB in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/NewSetup.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;New Setup&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For my second attempt at BIAB, after the Stone &amp;amp; Wood replica, I decided to go with a popular NEIPA recipe. The beer is meant to be cloudy orange, with big juicy fruity notes and a nice thickness to it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This time around, I decided I needed to control the fermentation temperature a little better. I picked up an Inkbird ITC-308 Wifi digital temperature controller and hooked it up to an old bar fridge with a heating element in order to keep the temperature stable. The controller seems to be working very well, it keeps everything at a steady range and allows me to monitor temps from an android app as well as adjust temperatures as need be.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While my mead is fermenting, I decided i’ll make my second ever batch of beer. This time I decided to scale things up to 23L and go with an all grain Pacific Ale BIAB (similar to Stone and Wood). For this I bought a 35L brew pot as well as a 30L plastic fermenter with airlock and thermometer. The specs of the Pacific Ale are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Date: 24/5/19&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Boil Time: 60 min&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Batch Size: 20L (fermenter volume)&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Boil Size: 25L&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Mash: 30L at 66 °C for 60 min&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Target OG: 1.046&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Target FG: 1.008&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Target ABV: 5.05%&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After just having completed my first ever beer (IPA), I decided i’d chuck something into the fermenter so something is constantly being brewed and I can get a larger fermenter for other beer batches. I decided to go with mead because it takes a while to ferment, it gets pretty strong, it’s easy to brew and it can be pretty tasty once its fully mellowed out. Specifications:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Date: 8/5/2019&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Vessel: Glass Carboy&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Batch: 4.5L&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Honey: 2kg&lt;br&gt;&#xA;OG: 1.135&lt;br&gt;&#xA;FG: 1.016&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Yeast: Mangrove Jacks Mead Yeast&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Target ABV: 14%&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Primary fermenter: 1 month&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Bottle: 3 months to 1 year&lt;/p&gt;</description>
