      <description>This beer was designed to clone Balter&amp;rsquo;s XPA and be close as possible to the original. The head brewers released the hops they used, but not the grains or yeast. The clone grist consisted primarily of American Pale malt with some wheat and carapils for body/head retention and some cara malt for malty flavour. The water profile was higher in calcium and suflate to accentuate the hops, of which were primarily citrus/fruity.</description>

      <title>German Lager</title>

      <description>This recipe was taken from Hoppy day&amp;rsquo;s recipe list as a standard german pilsener/lager. Grain bill was mostly german pilsener with some gladiator malt for head retention and body, as well as some acidulated malt to lower the mash pH and get as many fermentable sugars as possible. This was aided with a low mash temp. Yeast is Saflager 34/70 being fermented around 10-12c for 2 weeks with a 6-8 week lager in the keg.</description>

      <description>This was my first fruit kettle sour/berliner weisse. I decided to go with pureed strawberries at the end of the boil and sour using IBS capsules. The wort was pre acidified with lactic acid and acidulated malt to aid the souring. Some citra hops were used to add a bit more depth and flavour and citrus backing to the beer. Next time I&amp;rsquo;d probably add the fruit in primary at the end of fermentation to get a fresher flavour, as boiling the strawberry made it taste slightly different and somewhat artificial.</description>

      <description>Grain Bill
-Base is pilsner, Vienna and Wheat malt to add body, head and character with a slight maltiness from the Vienna. Acidulated malt to lower mash pH. Hops
-Bittering hops to give approximately 30 IBUs and add spicy and fruity notes.
-Kent Goldings, Saaz, or Willamette to add mild floral/herbal notes without overpowering the fruit.
Water Chemistry
Calcium: 50
Magnesium: 5
Sodium: 20
Chloride: 30
Sulfate: 100
-Higher sulfates will give aid in drying out the beer and accentuating the hops/fruit.</description>

      <title>Leftover IPA</title>

      <description>Distilled water will be used in order to customise the water chemistry (30L plus 2L of tap water for the remaining sparge). Adding 6.5g of calcium sulfate (gypsum), 3g of calcium chloride, 4g of magnesium sulfate (epsom salt) and 1 gram of baking sodat to the strike water will give a mash + sparge water profile of:
Calcium 74 ppm
Magnesium 13 ppm
Sodium 11 ppm
Chloride 50 ppm
Sulfate 165 ppm</description>

      <description>Designing the Recipe
This time around, i’m going to be partly designing my own recipe for a coffee stout. This stout is basically going to follow these guidelines:
-ABV between 5% and 7%.
-Grain bill of 80% base malt + remaining specialty grains.
-Between 30 and 40 IBUs from bittering additions of hops, with some at the end of the boil.
-An Ale yeast with an attenuation of approximately 75% (Us-04/05 or wyeast 1056 American Ale)</description>

      <description>This time around, I decided to go with a Mango IPA since I love mango and wanted to try making a fruit beer. I now have my Brewzilla 3.1 35L setup and a better, larger fermentation fridge. Hopefully this will up the quality of my homebrew and make the process a lot easier. The Mango is added during fermentation with the hops and left for a week or two.

      <description>Last week, I purchased the Brewzilla 3.1 35L all-in-one brewing system along with a few bits and pieces. I also bought a huge fermentation fridge that should let me control temperature a lot better. My next brewday (Mango IPA) will be the first using this new system after only using BIAB in the past.</description>

      <title>Juicy NEIPA BIAB</title>

      <description>For my second attempt at BIAB, after the Stone &amp;amp; Wood replica, I decided to go with a popular NEIPA recipe. The beer is meant to be cloudy orange, with big juicy fruity notes and a nice thickness to it.
This time around, I decided I needed to control the fermentation temperature a little better. I picked up an Inkbird ITC-308 Wifi digital temperature controller and hooked it up to an old bar fridge with a heating element in order to keep the temperature stable.</description>

      <description>While my mead is fermenting, I decided i’ll make my second ever batch of beer. This time I decided to scale things up to 23L and go with an all grain Pacific Ale BIAB (similar to Stone and Wood). For this I bought a 35L brew pot as well as a 30L plastic fermenter with airlock and thermometer. The specs of the Pacific Ale are as follows:

      <description>After just having completed my first ever beer (IPA), I decided i’d chuck something into the fermenter so something is constantly being brewed and I can get a larger fermenter for other beer batches. I decided to go with mead because it takes a while to ferment, it gets pretty strong, it’s easy to brew and it can be pretty tasty once its fully mellowed out. Specifications:
