      <description>Time for another sour! This time it&amp;rsquo;s going to be Mango, utilising 3kg of mango puree. The process will be the same kettle sour as my previous ones:
- Flaked Oats will be added to give the beer body, mouthfeel and slight sweetness.
- Fruit addition will be added during primary/secondary to get a fresher flavour and avoid cooked-flavours.
- A mesh bag will be used to catch the fruit particles and make kegging easier.</description>

      <description>This time around, I decided to go with a Mango IPA since I love mango and wanted to try making a fruit beer. I now have my Brewzilla 3.1 35L setup and a better, larger fermentation fridge. Hopefully this will up the quality of my homebrew and make the process a lot easier. The Mango is added during fermentation with the hops and left for a week or two.
