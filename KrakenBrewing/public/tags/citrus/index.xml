      <description>&lt;p&gt;The inspiration for this beer came from a night several years ago when I was working as a bartender. Myself and a few others headed to an American-style bar across the road on our break, for some food and beers. I ended up getting a Blue Moon on tap, not knowing what it is and expecting it to be a thin, watered down American lager. I was surprised to receive the opposite, a full-bodied, rich, citrusy and spicy Belgian-style ale with a slice of orange in it. It was fantastic, and that is the style and moment  I&amp;rsquo;m trying to recreate with this beer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
