      <description>2ï»¿022 was a good year for brewing - I definitely got back into the swing of things and was able to brew a lot more beer than in 2021. While there was some dud beers (mostly due to oxidation..), the beers in general definitely improved in quality. I recognised that I branched out in styles as well, experimenting with different spices and yeasts. Of these, the Beglian White Ale (Witbier), Aussie Sparkling Ale and Mango Lassi sour were 3 notable beers that involved new ways of brewing with spices and different hop varietals.</description>

      <description>Grain Bill
-Base is pilsner, Vienna and Wheat malt to add body, head and character with a slight maltiness from the Vienna. Acidulated malt to lower mash pH. Hops
-Bittering hops to give approximately 30 IBUs and add spicy and fruity notes.
-Kent Goldings, Saaz, or Willamette to add mild floral/herbal notes without overpowering the fruit.
Water Chemistry
Calcium: 50
Magnesium: 5
Sodium: 20
Chloride: 30
Sulfate: 100
-Higher sulfates will give aid in drying out the beer and accentuating the hops/fruit.</description>
