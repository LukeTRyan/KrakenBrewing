      <description>&lt;p&gt;I think this is my 3rd time making this beer, and I&amp;rsquo;m making it again because I think it&amp;rsquo;s great hazy ale. In the past, I&amp;rsquo;ve had issues around oxidation for these hoppy and oaty beers, but now I&amp;rsquo;m at a comfortable place with controlling oxidation through use of preservatives and techniques like closed transfers. When I ordered this beer, I could only get a hold of golden oat malt, which I decided to use. Due to that, the beer ended up a bit darker than I had hoped, but the taste was actually pretty damn good.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A﻿fter my last pacific/wheat ale, and success using sodium metabisulfite and ascorbic acid, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to take another crack at a Hazy IPA. This beer will feature Nectaron, which I&amp;rsquo;m trying for the first time, as well as BRU-1 and El Dorado, which I&amp;rsquo;ve had good results with in the past. As with my other Hazies, I&amp;rsquo;m aiming for a 2:1 chloride to sulfate ratio, heavy whirlpool and dry hop additions, and I&amp;rsquo;m looking to reduce oxidation as much as possible. I&amp;rsquo;ll be closed transferring under pressure and using SMB and ascorbic acid at my terminal dry hop.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Safe Bet NEIPA</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;D﻿ecided to have another crack at a hoppy hazy with this recipe from some dude on Facebook. For this brew, I&amp;rsquo;m trying out suspending the hops in a bag using magnets.. as a final effort to avoid oxidation. Closed transfers don&amp;rsquo;t seem to be working well enough, and I figured it may be due to opening the fermenter for dry hop additions, so we&amp;rsquo;ll see how this goes. I kinda screwed it up though because the hop bag is too big for the fermenter headspace.. so now the hops are slightly touching the wort. I&amp;rsquo;ll try limit the fermentation time of this batch to not drag out the hop exposure. I also forgot to use a Whirfloc tablet, but it might help contribute some slight haze. Ultimate goal of this batch is to just avoid oxidation. I&amp;rsquo;m also trying liquid yeast for the first time (Bluestone Yeast Co. New England ale strain). Hopefully it goes well, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t cheap.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Hoppy Days Hazy Crusher (Session Neipa)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a recipe I took from Hoppy Days Brewing Supplies (Brisbane), which is a session NEIPA. This beer features low bitterness, heavily fruity/critrus hops and a full body with plenty of high-protein malts. This brew makes use of Verdant IPA yeast, which will aid in creating this hazy, hoppy fruit bomb. Although i&amp;rsquo;ve brewed this beer before, the first time was a dump due to heavy oxidation. This time around, I&amp;rsquo;m utilising the Fermzilla 27L to do a pressurised, closed transfer ferment, to avoid any oxidation. Hops will be loaded into the collection container and purged with CO2, to remove any possibility of oxygen getting in.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This recipe is adapted from the HoppyDays Hazy Crusher IPA, a hazy session IPA with low bitterness, low ABV and a large dry hop addition. The yeast being used for this beer is the new Verdant IPA yeast. &lt;br&gt;&#xA;Target mash pH: 5.4 (need 5ml lactic acid)&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Target water profile: Approximately 2-1 chloride to sulfate&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hazy Session IPA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Brew Method: All Grain&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Style Name: American IPA&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Boil Time: 60 min&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Batch Size: 23 liters (fermentor volume)&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Boil Size: 27 liters&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Boil Gravity: 1.048&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Efficiency: 70% (brew house)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Juicy NEIPA BIAB</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/post/2019-09-10-neipa/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For my second attempt at BIAB, after the Stone &amp;amp; Wood replica, I decided to go with a popular NEIPA recipe. The beer is meant to be cloudy orange, with big juicy fruity notes and a nice thickness to it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This time around, I decided I needed to control the fermentation temperature a little better. I picked up an Inkbird ITC-308 Wifi digital temperature controller and hooked it up to an old bar fridge with a heating element in order to keep the temperature stable. The controller seems to be working very well, it keeps everything at a steady range and allows me to monitor temps from an android app as well as adjust temperatures as need be.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
