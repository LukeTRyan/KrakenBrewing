      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;tips-to-avoid-oxidation-in-homebrew&#34;&gt;Tï»¿ips to avoid oxidation in homebrew&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Brewing beer at home can be extremely rewarding. There&amp;rsquo;s no greater satisfaction than reaching a level of proficiency when you can comfortably say &amp;ldquo;I would pay to drink this in a pub&amp;rdquo;. However, with certain styles of beer and on a homebrew scale and budget, reaching that level (consistently) can be difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Oxidation is without a doubt one of the biggest banes of my existence (and a lot of other homebrewers out there). It can completely ruin a beer, and you&amp;rsquo;ll usually only know after brewing, fermenting and spending a huge amount of time and effort. When you reach that final stage and see that you&amp;rsquo;re beer is darkened in colour, lacks flavour and aroma, and tastes like wet cardboard, the only option is usually to dump it down the drain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
