      <description>Summer time means fruity sour. My homebrew shop is currently out of Wildbrew Philly sour, a strain of yeast that produces lactic acid as well as alcohol. This yeast has been my go-to for sours for the last couple of years, as it&amp;rsquo;s a lot less effort than kettle sours and produces similar results. However, I&amp;rsquo;m strapped for time given I want this beer done by Christmas, and Philly Sour isn&amp;rsquo;t really an option, so I&amp;rsquo;m going back to my kettle-sour roots.</description>

      <description>A﻿fter my last pacific/wheat ale, and success using sodium metabisulfite and ascorbic acid, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to take another crack at a Hazy IPA. This beer will feature Nectaron, which I&amp;rsquo;m trying for the first time, as well as BRU-1 and El Dorado, which I&amp;rsquo;ve had good results with in the past. As with my other Hazies, I&amp;rsquo;m aiming for a 2:1 chloride to sulfate ratio, heavy whirlpool and dry hop additions, and I&amp;rsquo;m looking to reduce oxidation as much as possible.</description>

      <description>I﻿n an effort to refine the Stone &amp;amp; Wood clone from this post, I&amp;rsquo;ve updated the recipe based on the results and inspiration from other sources (see link in notes). For the new batch, I&amp;rsquo;m adding some flaked wheat to add some more haze, and i&amp;rsquo;m lowering the percentage of ale malt. I&amp;rsquo;m also switching to american ale malt, in order to get a lighter colour. Finally, I&amp;rsquo;m increasing the dry hop to 100g and maintaining IBUs at around 22.</description>

      <description>Going ahead with another fruited sour using the Philly Sour yeast. This time I think I&amp;rsquo;ll do a mix of darker fruits (Blackberry, Cherry &amp;amp; Raspberry) and see how that goes. Like my last sour, I&amp;rsquo;ve added some lactose to counteract the sourness. I also added some dextrose to the boil to give the yeast some glucose for lactic acid production. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably add the fruit around day 5-6, purge with some c02 and leave for 3-4 days until fermentation finishes.</description>

      <description>D﻿ecided to have another crack at a hoppy hazy with this recipe from some dude on Facebook. For this brew, I&amp;rsquo;m trying out suspending the hops in a bag using magnets.. as a final effort to avoid oxidation. Closed transfers don&amp;rsquo;t seem to be working well enough, and I figured it may be due to opening the fermenter for dry hop additions, so we&amp;rsquo;ll see how this goes. I kinda screwed it up though because the hop bag is too big for the fermenter headspace.</description>

      <description>I decided to make a basic Australian Ale after having some bad luck with hazy, hoppy beers oxidising. Hoppy Days Brewing Supplies had this recipe for a Sparkling Ale, reminiscent of Coopers Sparkling Ale. This beer makes use of Australian malts (Voyager Pale Compass) and Australian hops (Pride of Ringwood) for a boil addition. Yeast used was SafAle k-97, a traditional german ale yeast.

      <title>Hoppy Days Hazy Crusher (Session Neipa)</title>

      <description>This is a recipe I took from Hoppy Days Brewing Supplies (Brisbane), which is a session NEIPA. This beer features low bitterness, heavily fruity/critrus hops and a full body with plenty of high-protein malts. This brew makes use of Verdant IPA yeast, which will aid in creating this hazy, hoppy fruit bomb. Although i&amp;rsquo;ve brewed this beer before, the first time was a dump due to heavy oxidation. This time around, I&amp;rsquo;m utilising the Fermzilla 27L to do a pressurised, closed transfer ferment, to avoid any oxidation.</description>

      <description>This Passionfruit and Vanilla sour was the next sour ale I had lined up in my list of fruited sours. This time around I&amp;rsquo;m using Lallemand&amp;rsquo;s Philly Sour yeast - A lactic acid producing yeast. This will be my first sour without using traditional kettle souring techniques with Lactobacillus Plantarum, so I&amp;rsquo;m interested to see how it turns out. Some people have said that this strain produces less lactic acid and thus less sourness than kettle souring, but this generally comes down to yeast health and fermentation conditions.</description>

      <title>Balter XPA Clone</title>

      <description>This beer was designed to clone Balter&amp;rsquo;s XPA and be close as possible to the original. The head brewers released the hops they used, but not the grains or yeast. The clone grist consisted primarily of American Pale malt with some wheat and carapils for body/head retention and some cara malt for malty flavour. The water profile was higher in calcium and suflate to accentuate the hops, of which were primarily citrus/fruity.</description>
