      <description>I﻿t&amp;rsquo;s been a few years since I&amp;rsquo;ve done a stout, and winters coming up, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d give it another crack. The last stout I made was a coffee chocolate stout, which used cold-brew coffee and cacao nibs soaked in congac. It was pretty good, but I wanted to do something different this time. I&amp;rsquo;ll be keeping a similar grain bill and hops (Fuggles), but I&amp;rsquo;ll be adding lactose to round out the bitterness, and I&amp;rsquo;ll also be adding cacao nibs and 2 vanilla beans.</description>

      <description>Designing the Recipe
This time around, i’m going to be partly designing my own recipe for a coffee stout. This stout is basically going to follow these guidelines:
-ABV between 5% and 7%.
-Grain bill of 80% base malt + remaining specialty grains.
-Between 30 and 40 IBUs from bittering additions of hops, with some at the end of the boil.
-An Ale yeast with an attenuation of approximately 75% (Us-04/05 or wyeast 1056 American Ale)</description>
