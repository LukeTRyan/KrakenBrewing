      <description>&lt;p&gt;For this brew I&amp;rsquo;m trying out cryo hops for the first time in this &lt;a href=&#34;https://untappd.com/b/bracket-brewing-insert-name/5250659&#34;&gt;Bracket Brewing &amp;ldquo;Insert Name&amp;rdquo; hazy pale ale&lt;/a&gt;. This recipe was adapted from a homebrewer who queried bracket brewing on their hazy pale ale recipe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The grain bill for this beer is mostly pale malt, with a huge 30% of rolled oats and about 5% honey malt to give colour and a slightly sweeter/malty finish.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The hops for this beer are Motueka, Idaho#7 and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cryopopblend.com/&#34;&gt;Cryo Pop&lt;/a&gt;, previously known as trial blend TRI2304CR. Recent research suggests that high levels of monoterpene alcohols and polyfunctional thiols in a wort stream can create the conditions necessary for the yeast metabolism of hop-derived compounds, otherwise known as “biotransformation.” This hop blend has been developed to make use of briotransformation and to work as both a single hop or in conjunction with other tropical hop varietals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Hazy Crusher (DDH Session NEIPA)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I think this is my 3rd time making this beer, and I&amp;rsquo;m making it again because I think it&amp;rsquo;s great hazy ale. In the past, I&amp;rsquo;ve had issues around oxidation for these hoppy and oaty beers, but now I&amp;rsquo;m at a comfortable place with controlling oxidation through use of preservatives and techniques like closed transfers. When I ordered this beer, I could only get a hold of golden oat malt, which I decided to use. Due to that, the beer ended up a bit darker than I had hoped, but the taste was actually pretty damn good.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>DDH Oat Cream Tropical Hazy IPA</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A﻿fter my last pacific/wheat ale, and success using sodium metabisulfite and ascorbic acid, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to take another crack at a Hazy IPA. This beer will feature Nectaron, which I&amp;rsquo;m trying for the first time, as well as BRU-1 and El Dorado, which I&amp;rsquo;ve had good results with in the past. As with my other Hazies, I&amp;rsquo;m aiming for a 2:1 chloride to sulfate ratio, heavy whirlpool and dry hop additions, and I&amp;rsquo;m looking to reduce oxidation as much as possible. I&amp;rsquo;ll be closed transferring under pressure and using SMB and ascorbic acid at my terminal dry hop.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Safe Bet NEIPA</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;D﻿ecided to have another crack at a hoppy hazy with this recipe from some dude on Facebook. For this brew, I&amp;rsquo;m trying out suspending the hops in a bag using magnets.. as a final effort to avoid oxidation. Closed transfers don&amp;rsquo;t seem to be working well enough, and I figured it may be due to opening the fermenter for dry hop additions, so we&amp;rsquo;ll see how this goes. I kinda screwed it up though because the hop bag is too big for the fermenter headspace.. so now the hops are slightly touching the wort. I&amp;rsquo;ll try limit the fermentation time of this batch to not drag out the hop exposure. I also forgot to use a Whirfloc tablet, but it might help contribute some slight haze. Ultimate goal of this batch is to just avoid oxidation. I&amp;rsquo;m also trying liquid yeast for the first time (Bluestone Yeast Co. New England ale strain). Hopefully it goes well, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t cheap.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Hoppy Days Hazy Crusher (Session Neipa)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a recipe I took from Hoppy Days Brewing Supplies (Brisbane), which is a session NEIPA. This beer features low bitterness, heavily fruity/critrus hops and a full body with plenty of high-protein malts. This brew makes use of Verdant IPA yeast, which will aid in creating this hazy, hoppy fruit bomb. Although i&amp;rsquo;ve brewed this beer before, the first time was a dump due to heavy oxidation. This time around, I&amp;rsquo;m utilising the Fermzilla 27L to do a pressurised, closed transfer ferment, to avoid any oxidation. Hops will be loaded into the collection container and purged with CO2, to remove any possibility of oxygen getting in.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Hazy Session IPA</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This recipe is adapted from the HoppyDays Hazy Crusher IPA, a hazy session IPA with low bitterness, low ABV and a large dry hop addition. The yeast being used for this beer is the new Verdant IPA yeast. &lt;br&gt;&#xA;Target mash pH: 5.4 (need 5ml lactic acid)&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Target water profile: Approximately 2-1 chloride to sulfate&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hazy Session IPA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Brew Method: All Grain&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Style Name: American IPA&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Boil Time: 60 min&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Batch Size: 23 liters (fermentor volume)&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Boil Size: 27 liters&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Boil Gravity: 1.048&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Efficiency: 70% (brew house)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Distilled water will be used in order to customise the water chemistry (30L plus 2L of tap water for the remaining sparge). Adding 6.5g of calcium sulfate (gypsum), 3g of calcium chloride, 4g of magnesium sulfate (epsom salt) and 1 gram of baking sodat to the strike water will give a mash + sparge water profile of:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Calcium 74 ppm&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Magnesium 13 ppm&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Sodium 11 ppm&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Chloride 50 ppm&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Sulfate 165 ppm&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The higher calcium and sulfate ions (low chloride/sulfate ratio) will enhance bitterness and bring out more hop flavour. Adding 100g of Acidulated Malt will bring down the mash pH to the desired level of 5.45 (room temp mash pH).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Mango IPA</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This time around, I decided to go with a Mango IPA since I love mango and wanted to try making a fruit beer. I now have my Brewzilla 3.1 35L setup and a better, larger fermentation fridge. Hopefully this will up the quality of my homebrew and make the process a lot easier. The Mango is added during fermentation with the hops and left for a week or two.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mango IPA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.brewersfriend.com/homebrew/recipe/view/369037/hey-mango-ipa&#34;&gt;R﻿ecipe link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
