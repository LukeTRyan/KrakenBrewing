      <description>Iï»¿n an effort to refine the Stone &amp;amp; Wood clone from this post, I&amp;rsquo;ve updated the recipe based on the results and inspiration from other sources (see link in notes). For the new batch, I&amp;rsquo;m adding some flaked wheat to add some more haze, and i&amp;rsquo;m lowering the percentage of ale malt. I&amp;rsquo;m also switching to american ale malt, in order to get a lighter colour. Finally, I&amp;rsquo;m increasing the dry hop to 100g and maintaining IBUs at around 22.</description>

      <description>The second beer I ever made was my first time going all grain. This recipe (here) was a Stone &amp;amp; Wood clone, designed to loosely resemble the beer. While this was one of the most successful beers I&amp;rsquo;ve made, I decided to re-do it, this time with a much better, fine-tuned setup. The aim of this is to get an understanding on the impact of changing certain aspects to a brew and how they affect the end result.</description>
